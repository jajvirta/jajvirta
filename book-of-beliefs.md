# Beliefs about how things are and how they should be
Author: Jarno Virtanen

This was inspired by [Buster Benson's book of
beliefs](https://github.com/busterbenson/public/blob/master/book-of-beliefs.md)
and the [article referring to
it](https://medium.com/thinking-is-hard/live-like-a-hydra-c02337782a89). Seems
like a good idea.


> *What is this document?* This public, living, document was created as an experiment one Sunday in April of 2012. Maintaining it has become one of the most treasured activities in my life. Itâ€™s a way for me to remember who I am, catch inconsistencies in how I respond to different events in the world, react to current events from a position of how I believe the world is, should be, and will become. I've updated it at least once a year since 2012, and all changes are tracked. Rather than attempting to avoid all errors in this doc, I'm attempting to be as specific as possible and to quickly correct errors when they become apparent.

> *Why does it exist?* My main goal here is to get smarter over time by identifying new connections and inconsistencies so I can course-correct when necessary. A secondary goal is that I'd also like to extend an invitiation for others to spark conversations with me about anything they find interesting and to also help keep me accountable.

> *Who's beliefs are these?* I'm Buster Benson. These beliefs are my best guess and articulation of my own beliefs, which were inherited and molded partly by the environment I've lived in and partly by my own interpretation of life experiences. Your mileage may vary. Caveat lector.

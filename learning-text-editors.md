# Nevermind efficiency, study your text editor because it's fun

Some people say that you should learn a powerful text editor like for example
Vim, Emacs, or Sublime in proper depth, because it will increase your
productivity. It sure sounds like a good reason and I'm all for increased
productivity. But if you actually start summing up the saved time and
deducting the time it took you to get there, the calculation quickly becomes
impossible.

But I don't think it matters. I think the reason you should start learning
your text editor more thoroughly is simply because it's fun. It is fun to
learn. It is fun to become more proficient. It is fun to *be* good at
something.  And it is even more fun to spread your proficiency to others.

You can use the hand-wavy arguments of becoming more productive as an excuse
to learn your text editor.  And if you do become faster and more efficient,
all the better.

## Hello, my name is Jarno and I'm a Vim convert. (But don't worry, I won't try to convert you.)

I used to be a half-decent Emacs user and now I'm a half-decent Vim user. I
can't remember the exact date when I made the dramatic shift, but it was about
a year ago because that's when I made the first commit to my `.vimrc`. One of
the reasons for switching to Vim was that I was too complacent with my
mediocre Emacs skills and I hoped that such radical switch would force me to
learn better habits.

I can't claim to be a Vim wizard yet, but I've certainly been on a interesting
journey to learn a totally different editor. I was highly skeptical of Vim's
basic philosophy of modality, but I eventually got used to it and now I really
like modal editing. But I'm NOT saying that every programmer should learn Vim.
I am saying that every programmer should learn an editor that is powerful
enough. I know both Emacs and Vim fit the bill, but I'm sure Sublime and many
other modern text editors are fine choices as well.

I think the editor of your choice has to have multitude of powerful ways to edit
text. It should have a convenient way to extend its functionality. And I think you
should be able to customize it.

## Learning is fun! No, it really is.

I'll save you the trouble of googling for Vim's learning curve:

There's some truth to the graph, but it misses some important points. First,
you can manage your way around Vim in just few basic lessons. Second, you
never quite learn Vim completely. The shape of the learning curve is different
for other editors, but I think you should pick one that continues to offer
more ways to learn it and to make it more efficient for your needs.

The fun of my Vim learning journey is just the fact that I know that I can always
learn more Vim. When you look at it as an opportunity, not as a constant state of
failure, it becomes empowering. Whenever I get the urge to learn something new 
about my editor of choice, I know there's some aspect of it that I can master
better or there's some corner that I tweak to be a little better.

Just recently I tweaked the setting to show trailing whitespace to more
convenient Unicode characters (as shown by Damian Conway in his XXX talk):

    exec "set listchars=tab:\uBB\uBB,nbsp:~,trail:\uB7"
    set list

It's not a big deal, but it made me a little happier.

## Embracing the newbie state of mind

Learning a new editor is fun and exciting also because you are allowed to be a
newbie again. No one, not even you yourself, is expecting you to be an expert
at the new skill immediately and this frees you to concentrate on learning and
not on appearing competent. Obviously you shouldn't learn at the cost of
whatever you're really doing, but eventually you will become more efficient
and the initial hurdle will have paid off.



Just the feeling of becoming more efficient and proficient feels enjoyable.

## Appendum: store your configuration files at Github or Bitbucket

One particular fun of using these customizable and tweakable editors is that I
can leverage whatever I've customized by

## Build a habit of automating stuff

Steve Yegge said in [one his Drunken Blog
Rants](https://sites.google.com/site/steveyegge2/saving-time) that you
should build a habit of automating stuff. Not because automation always pays
off as saved time, but because it's a good habit to be in. Because by
constantly automating stuff you eventually become more effective and more
productive. If you start making too detailed cost-benefit calculations, you
will never step in the path of automation and never yield the benefits either.

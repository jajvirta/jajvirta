# Forget efficiency, you should learn your text editor for fun

Some people suggest that you should learn a powerful text editor like Vim,
Emacs or, say, Sublime in proper depth, because it will increase your
productivity. It sure sounds like a good reason and I'm all for increased
productivity. But if you actually start summing up your productivity increases
and deducting the time it took you to get there, it quickly gets quite messy.

XXX ? Sure, you might get a nice back-of-the-envelope calculation that says that if
you save your work hundred thousand times in a decade and you shave off a
keystroke of it, you'll save given number of hours of time. But in real life,
the actual calculcation quickly becomes impossible.

But I don't think it matters. I think the reason you should start learning
your text editor more thoroughly is simply because it's fun. It is fun to
learn, it is fun become more proficient and it is fun to *be* good at
something. And even more importantly, it is fun to be able to control your
environment. [XXX move to start?] You can use the hand-wavy arguments of
becoming more productive as an excuse to learn your text editor. And if
you do, in fact, become faster and more efficient, all the better.

## Hello, my name is Jarno and I'm a Vim convert

I used to be a half-decent Emacs user and now I'm a half-decent Vim user. I
can't remember the exact date that made the dramatic shift, but it was about a
year ago since that's when I made the first commit to my `.vimrc`. One of the
reasons for my switch was the fact that I was too complacent with my mediocre
Emacs skills and I hoped that such radical switch would force me to learn new,
better habits.

I can't claim to be a Vim wizard yet, but I've certainly been on a interesting
journey to learn a totally different editor. I was highly skeptical of Vim's
basic philosophy of modality, but I eventually got used to the Vim style of
editing and now I really like it. But I'm NOT going to say that every
programmer should start using Vim. I'm saying every programmer should learn an
editor that is powerful enough.

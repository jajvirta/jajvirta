# Forget efficiency, you should learn your text editor because it's fun

Some people suggest that you should learn a powerful text editor like Vim,
Emacs or, say, Sublime in proper depth, because it will increase your
productivity. It sure sounds like a good reason and I'm all for increased
productivity. But if you actually start summing the saved time and deducting
the time it took you to get there, the calculation becomes impossible. 

But I don't think it matters. I think the reason you should start learning
your text editor more thoroughly is simply because it's fun. It is fun to
learn. It is fun to become more proficient. It is fun to *be* good at
something.  And it is even more fun to spread your proficiency to others. And
furthermore, it is fun to be able to control your environment. You can use the
hand-wavy arguments of becoming more productive as an excuse to learn your
text editor.  And if you do become faster and more efficient, all
the better.

## Hello, my name is Jarno and I'm a Vim convert. (But don't worry, I won't try to convert you.)

I used to be a half-decent Emacs user and now I'm a half-decent Vim user. I
can't remember the exact date when I made the dramatic shift, but it was about
a year ago because that's when I made the first commit to my `.vimrc`. One of
the reasons for switching to Vim was that I was too complacent with my
mediocre Emacs skills and I hoped that such radical switch would force me to
learn new, better habits.

I can't claim to be a Vim wizard yet, but I've certainly been on a interesting
journey to learn a totally different editor. I was highly skeptical of Vim's
basic philosophy of modality, but I eventually got used to the Vim style of
editing and now I really like it. But I'm NOT going to say that every
programmer should learning Vim. I am saying every programmer should learn an
editor that is powerful enough. I know both Emacs and Vim fit the bill, but
I'm sure Sublime and many other modern text editors are fine choices as well.

I think the editor of your choice has to have multitude of powerful ways to edit 
text. It should have a convenient way to extend its functionality. And I think you
should be able to customize it.

## Learning is fun! No, it really is.

I'll save you the trouble of googling for Vim's learning curve:

There's some truth to the graph, but it misses some important points. First, you
can manage your way around Vim in just few basic lessons. Second, you never quite learn
Vim completely. The shape of the learning curve is different for other editors, but
I think you should pick one that does not ceil up XXX too soon. 

The fun of my Vim learning journey is just the fact that I know that I can always
learn more Vim. When you look at it as an opportunity, not as a constant state of
failure, it becomes empowering. Whenever I get the urge to learn something new 
about my editor of choice, I know there's some aspect of it that I can master
better.
